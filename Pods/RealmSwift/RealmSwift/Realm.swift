/**
A Realm instance (also referred to as "a realm") represents a Realm
database.

Realms can either be stored on disk (see `init(path:)`) or in
memory (see `Configuration`).

Realm instances are cached internally, and constructing equivalent Realm
objects (with the same path or identifier) produces limited overhead.

If you specifically want to ensure a Realm object is
destroyed (for example, if you wish to open a realm, check some property, and
then possibly delete the realm file and re-open it), place the code which uses
the realm within an `autoreleasepool {}` and ensure you have no other
strong references to it.

- warning: Realm instances are not thread safe and can not be shared across
           threads or dispatch queues. You must construct a new instance on each thread you want
           to interact with the realm on. For dispatch queues, this means that you must
           call it in each block which is dispatched, as a queue is not guaranteed to run
           on a consistent thread.
